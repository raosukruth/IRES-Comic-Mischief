# Dynamic Pretraining of Multimodal models for Recognition of Questionable Content in Videos
This repository contains Binary and Multi task models for detecting comic mischief content. A mechanism is defined to train and evaluate both the models as task heads. 

# TODO
1. Complete support for eval
2. Integration of pretrained models with task heads

# How to test Task heads
Run the script "run.sh" by passing an argument as follows:
### Usage: ./run.sh <train|eval>
